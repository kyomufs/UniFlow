UniFlow turns the open TulSU schedule API into a fast, local-first mobile
app: live schedule with a change journal, subject notes, grades and task
tracking — all wrapped in a Material You (MD3) UI with dynamic theming.

## Features

- 📅 **Schedule** — live timetable from the open TulSU API, weekly/day view,
  groups, teachers, and offline cache; built-in demo mode without a network
- 🔄 **Change journal** — field-level diff of schedule updates
  (what changed, when, and what it was before), grouped by day
- 📝 **Notes** — per-subject notebooks with subfolders and rich structure
- 🎯 **Tasks** — status, priority, due dates and grades per subject
- 📊 **Grades** — performance tracking with statistics
- 🎨 **Material You** — dynamic color from a seed color, light/dark themes,
  M3 components (NavigationBar, SegmentedButton, Fitted type scale)
- 🔔 **Notifications** — alerts for schedule changes
- 🚀 **Self-updater (Android)** — checks GitHub releases on launch and
  offers a one-tap update with a download progress bar
- 📴 **Local-first** — Hive storage, no account required

## Installation

### iOS — SideStore

Tap the link on a device with SideStore installed to add the source:

**[Add UniFlow to SideStore](sidestore://source?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyomufs/UniFlow/main/sidestore/source.json)**

Manual fallback (SideStore → Settings → Sources → `+` → paste):

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyomufs/UniFlow/main/sidestore/source.json
```

> `sidestore/source.json` updates itself: right after each release is
> published, `release.yml` rewrites `version`, `versionDate`,
> `downloadURL` and `size` and pushes the change back to `main` — no
> manual edits needed.

### Android

Grab `UniFlow-<tag>.apk` from
[Releases](https://github.com/kyomufs/UniFlow/releases), or install an
older build and let the in-app updater offer the new one.

## Platforms

| Android | iOS | Web | Windows | Linux |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter **3.47.4** (or just [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/): the flake
  pins the whole toolchain)

### Run

```bash
cd uniflow
flutter pub get
flutter run            # or: flutter run -d chrome / windows / linux
```

With Nix the toolchain comes from the repo:

```bash
nix develop             # Flutter + JDK pinned by flake.lock
cd uniflow && flutter run
```

### Build releases locally

```bash
flutter build apk --release     # build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
flutter build ios --release     # requires macOS + Xcode
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions builds both platforms on every push to `main`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `android-build.yml` | push to `main`, PRs | tests + downloadable APK artifact |
| `ios-build.yml` | push to `main` | tests-free unsigned IPA artifact |
| `release.yml` | tag `v*` | **GitHub Release** with `UniFlow-<tag>.apk` and `UniFlow-<tag>.ipa` |

Cut a release:

```bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "UniFlow v1.1.0"
git push origin v1.1.0
```

That is all — the release workflow also refreshes
`sidestore/source.json` for the new version automatically (see
Installation above).

## Design

UniFlow follows [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io):

- color roles come from `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` (no hard-coded surfaces)
- tonal surfaces instead of elevation shadows
- MD3 components (`NavigationBar`, `SegmentedButton`, cards, dialogs)
